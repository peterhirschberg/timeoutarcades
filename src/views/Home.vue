    <p>Welcome to the virtual museum for Time-Out Tunnel Family Amusement Center. Time-Out Tunnel was a chain of mall-based arcades that existed back in the late 70s to early 80s. They were eventually bought out in the 90s by Namco but still exist at some locations as simply "Time-Out".</p>
    <p>This website is primarily focused on the original arcade chain from the early 80s era, however I would like for this website to serve as a repository for all things Time-Out, past and present.</p>
    <p>If you have suggestions or something to contribute PLEASE <a href="/#/Contact">contact me</a>.</p>
